dm-checked-types
----------------
Property types that add CHECK constraints to your DB and validations to your model. Data integrity FTW.

Usage:
  require 'dm-checked-types'

  class Product
    include DataMapper::Resource

    property :name, String, :key => true
    property, :amount, CheckedInteger[:gt => 0]
    property, :price,  CheckedInteger[:gte => 0]
  end
